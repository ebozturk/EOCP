# The source code of 'Determining the Optimal Cut-off Point for a Continuous Diagnostic Test: A Euclidean-Based Approach' manuscript


The medical decision-making process typically results in binary outcomes, detecting whether an individual has a certain medical condition or not. Different information sources, including patient complaints, symptoms, and diagnostic tests, are employed to confirm or exclude possible disorders. Although some diagnostic tests have limits in accurately distinguishing between individuals, they are extensively utilized in clinical settings because of their efficiency. Furthermore, for ordinal and continuous biomarkers, a prevalent method for distinguishing individuals is determining the optimal cut-off point. The identification of the optimal cut-off point through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is commonly reported in the literature. This study compares existing methodologies, including Youden's index (J), the point nearest to the (0,1) corner in the ROC plane (ER), the maximum achievable value of the chi-square statistic (minP), the product of sensitivity and specificity (CZ), and the minimization of the absolute difference between sensitivity and specificity (IU), with the proposed approach. The proposed approach is based on the Euclidean distance of observations in the data set. An extended simulation study was conducted for comparison with the proposed model. Furthermore, the suggested method exhibits the lowest relative bias and mean squared error (MSE) across the majority of scenarios.
